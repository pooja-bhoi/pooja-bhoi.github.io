### Global Warming 1880-2020

Since 1880, average global temperatures have increased by about 1 degrees Celsius. The dashboard shows that Northern Hemisphere has warmed more than the Southern Hemisphere mainly because of differences in how these areas reflect energy from the sun, uneven distribution of the continents and oceans around the globe, and the rise of green house gases due to transportation, industries, and population.

### Sentiment Analysis in British Airways customer reviews 

Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. I performed data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis, and then looked at topic modelling, sentiment analysis and wordclouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews. I used BeautifulSoup for web scrapping, NLTK library for NLP, vaderSentiment to analyze sentiment.
